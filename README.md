# p_fuel_api
An API for retrieving Indian petrol, diesel, and LPG pricing. I couldn't find a better API, so I made one. It may scale up and down as needed. I used AWS Lambda, which can handle millions of requests in a month. It may also scale down if traffic is low.

# Features
- By State : Sends out a Json response for all the cities in the state
    - Petrol
    - Diesel
    - LPG

# Details
Project is in the final stage, will bring up the link shortly!
